# Makaut Result Parser

This is an implementation of my existing project of `makaut-result-parser`. This is the web version of the previous project. Now anyone simply go into the website and take the advantage of this tool.

## How to setup

1. Install `python` on your system. Visit [python's official page](https://www.python.org/downloads) to download it.

2. Clone the repo.

3. Then install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. (It is preffered to use a virtual environment for this)

4. Then simply run the flask application using `python app.py` and then go the generated local IP address to use the site.

# Note

I am very new to web developement. Infact this is my first web application and I neither know `html` nor `css` nor `flask` very well. So, if anyone of you have any suggestion then feel free to drop me an email or connect with me on LinkedIn. I would be more than happy to receive any suggestions or constructive criticism.
